# User Stories
Start out by creating at least 5 user stories for your approved project. The outline/requirements for user stories can be found HERE

Each story in your project management board should contain:

1. As a Patient user, I want to create a visit on any medical center including: hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, labs and x-ray centers
2. As a Doctor user, I want to accept the visit from the patient 
3. As a Doctor user, I want to add the desease description on the patient profile
4. As a Doctor user, I want to write the required medicine for the patient
5. As a Pharmacy user, I want to modify the medicine for the patient
6. As a Pharmacy user, I want to approve the medicine for the patient
7. As a lab user, I want to upload the tests result on the patient profile
8. As a X-ray center user, I want to upload the x-rays on the patient profile
9. As an administrator, I want to add a data for the healthcare center
